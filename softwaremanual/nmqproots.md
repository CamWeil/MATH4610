1. **Routine Name:**           nmqproots

   **Author:** Cam Weil

   **Language:** C++

   **Description/Purpose:** This routine will compute the roots of a quadratic polynomial. This is a routine for solving any equation of the form ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c so long as a â‰  0.

   **Input:** There are inputs needed for a, b, and c.

   **Output:** This routine returns the two roots to the solution <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}" title="\Large x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}" />

   **Usage/Example:** The routine defines eight float variables, a, b, c, x1, x2, disc, xreal, and ximag. a, b, and c are inputs, and disc is the discriminant of the polynomial, which is given as:

        disc = b*b - 4*a*c;
   
   The value of this discriminant is then used to determine how the roots of the polynomial should be calculated. If the discriminant is positive or zero, then the roots are real and as such are given as:
   
        x1 = (-b + sqrt(disc))/(2*a);
        x2 = (-b - sqrt(disc))/(2*a);
        
   If the discriminant is negative, then the roots are complex and as such are given as:
   
        xreal = -b/(2*a);
        ximag = sqrt(-disc)/(2*a);

   **Implementation/Code:** The following is the code for nmqproots.cpp:

        #include<iostream>
        #include<math.h>
        using namespace std;

        int main(){

        float a, b, c, x1, x2, disc, xreal, ximag;

            cout << "Enter coefficient a: ";
            cin >> a;
    
                if(a == 0){
                    cout << "a cannot be 0. Enter coefficient a: ";
                    cin >> a;
                }
    
            cout << "Enter coefficient b: ";
            cin >> b;
            cout << "Enter coefficient c: ";
            cin >> c;
    
            disc = b*b - 4*a*c;
    
                if(disc >= 0){
                    x1 = (-b + sqrt(disc))/(2*a);
                    x2 = (-b - sqrt(disc))/(2*a);
                    cout << "x1 = " << x1 << endl;
                    cout << "x2 = " << x2 << endl;
                }
    
                else{
                    xreal = -b/(2*a);
                    ximag = sqrt(-disc)/(2*a);
                    cout << "x1 = " << xreal << " + " << ximag << "i" << endl;
                    cout << "x2 = " << xreal << " - " << ximag << "i" << endl;
                }

            return 0;
    
        };
