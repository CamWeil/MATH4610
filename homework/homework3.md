10. Problem: Perform an online search using the term Kronecker product. Find sites that describe the product and applications of the Kronecker product. Write up a paragraph or two describing this topic citing at least three web pages and/or web sites.

    Answer: Given a field F, the Kronecker product of two matrices is defined as <b>A</b> ⊗ <b>B</b> = \[a<sub>ij</sub>B\] for any matrices <b>A</b> = \[a<sub>ij</sub>\] ∈ F<sup>m x n</sup> and B ∈ F<sup>p x q</sup>. One application for the Kronecker product is the continuous Lyapunov equation AX + XA<sup>H</sup> = Q, respectively, with Q being a Hermitian matrix and A<sup>H</sup> being the Hermitian transpose of A. This equation is used in certain branches of control theory, such as stability analysis and optimal control, and it can be solved for using the Kronecker product in the equation (A<sup>T</sup> ⊗ I<sub>n</sub> + I<sub>n</sub> ⊗ A<sup>H</sup>)vec(X) = vec(Q), which has a unique solution X if and only if A<sup>H</sup> and −A<sup>T</sup> have no shared eigenvalues.
