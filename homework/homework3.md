10. Problem: Perform an online search using the term Kronecker product. Find sites that describe the product and applications of the Kronecker product. Write up a paragraph or two describing this topic citing at least three web pages and/or web sites.

    Answer: The Kronecker product, denoted by the symbol ⊗, is defined as <b>A</b> ⊗ <b>B</b> = \[a<sub>ij</sub>B\], where <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are matrices of aribtrary size over any ring. One application for the Kronecker product is the continuous Lyapunov equation XA + A<sup>/*</sup>X = H, respectively, with H being a Hermitian matrix and A<sup>/*</sup> being the conjugate transpose of A. This equation is used in stability analysis and optimal control, which can be solved for using the Kronecker product in the equation (A<sup>T</sup> ⊗ I + I ⊗ A<sup>/*</sup>)vec(X) = vec(H).
