11. Problem: Use an online search to find web sites and/or web pages that identify test problems for linear solvers. Write a summary of at least two of these sites. Download and include these examples in your software manual or provide links to the sites you use to test your own linear solution codes.

    Answer: [Matrix Market](https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/) is a repository of data that is used in the testing of algorithms for numerical linear algebra, providing matrix generation software and services for linear systems, least squares, and eigenvalue computations. Each matrix, or matrix set, has a home page that includes information about its properties and visualization of its structure, as well as allowing the matrix to be downloaded in one of several text file formats. Similarly, each matrix generator has a home page that includes information about its properties, which are either static software that can be downloaded and used in certain applications, Java applets for browser returns, or form-based requests for browser returns.
    
    [SuiteSparse Matrix Collection](https://sparse.tamu.edu/) is a large and growing set of sparse matrices that are relevant in real life applications, and it is used in the development and evaluation of sparse matrix algorithms. It allows for more robust performance experiments than artificially-generated matrices, as well as providing repeatability due to the fact that the matrices are available in many formats, providing accessibility through MATLAB, Mathematica, Fortran, and C, as well as covering a wide spectrum of domains, such as structural engineering, computational fluid dynamics, model reduction, electromagnetics, semiconductor devices, thermodynamics, materials, acoustics, computer graphics/vision, robotics/kinematics, optimization, circuit simulation, economic and financial modeling, theoretical and quantum chemistry, chemical process simulation, mathematics and statistics, power networks, and so on.
